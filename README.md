## Featured Projects 💻

 **[Project 1 Title]** [How Remote Work Influenced Domestic Water Consumption in the Wessex Region](project_1_link)

![Project 1 Screenshot](project_1_screenshot_url)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project investigates how the rise of remote and hybrid work patterns reshaped domestic water consumption across the Wessex region between 2017 and 2025. Using a modern analytics engineering stack (BigQuery, dbt, Fivetran, Looker), the project integrates multi‑source UK datasets to quantify behavioural shifts, identify spatial patterns, and explore potential public‑health implications.

The goal is to provide evidence‑based insights for water utilities, regulators, and environmental researchers.

---

## 🎯 Research Questions
- How did household water consumption change before, during, and after the shift to remote work?
- Which areas of the Wessex region experienced the largest changes?
- Did consumption trends correlate with water‑quality indicators (e.g., nitrates, phosphates, turbidity, microbiological contaminants)?
- How did demographic and socioeconomic factors influence consumption patterns?
- Which behavioural changes persisted beyond 2021?

## 🗂️ Data Sources

### **Water Consumption & Supply**
- Wessex Water domestic consumption datasets (2022-2024) 

### **Water Quality**
- Wessex Water domestic water quality datasets (2022-2024)
- 
### **Remote Work & Mobility**
- ONS Labour Force Survey (home‑working rates)    

## 🧱 Methodology

### **1. Data Ingestion**
- Automated ingestion via Fivetran (where connectors exist)  
- Manual ingestion for static datasets (Census, shapefiles)  
- Storage in BigQuery with raw, staging, and analytics layers  

### **2. Data Modelling (dbt)**
- Source‑aligned staging models  
- Surrogate keys for cross‑dataset joins  
- Time‑series models for 2017–2025 consumption  
- Spatial models linking LSOAs to supply zones  
- Feature engineering for:
  - remote‑work intensity  
  - weekday/weekend patterns  
  - seasonal adjustments  
  - water‑quality exceedances  

### **3. Analysis**
- Trend analysis across pre‑COVID, COVID, and post‑COVID periods  
- Correlation analysis between remote‑work intensity and consumption  

### **4. Visualisation**
Interactive Looker dashboards:
- Consumption heatmaps  
- Time‑series trends  
- Remote‑work vs consumption scatterplots  
- Water‑quality exceedance trackers

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Forecasting domestic water demand under remote‑work scenarios  
- Integrating climate variables (rainfall, temperature)  
- Linking consumption to household‑level socioeconomic indicators  
- Evaluating policy implications for water‑efficiency programmes
